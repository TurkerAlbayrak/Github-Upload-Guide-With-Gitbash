## 📌 Steps

### 1️⃣ Create a GitHub Repository

* Open your GitHub account and click **New Repository** 🆕.
* Give your repository a name (e.g., `my-first-project`) and optionally add a description.
* Choose repository visibility: **Public 🔓** or **Private 🔒**.
* Optionally add a **README.md** file to describe your project.
* Click **Create Repository** ✅.

### 2️⃣ Open Git Bash (or terminal)

* Open Git Bash on your computer.
* Navigate to your project folder:

  ```bash
  cd path/to/your/project
  ```
* **Tip:** Use `ls` (Linux/macOS) or `dir` (Windows) to verify you are in the correct folder.

### 3️⃣ Initialize Git in the Project

* Run the following command:

  ```bash
  git init
  ```
* **Note:** This creates a `.git` folder in your project which will track version history.

### 4️⃣ Add Files to Git

* Add all files in your project folder:

  ```bash
  git add .
  ```
* **Tip:** To add specific files only:

  ```bash
  git add index.html style.css
  ```

### 5️⃣ Commit the Changes

* Commit your changes with a meaningful message:

  ```bash
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```

* **Tip:** Commit messages should describe what changes were made.

* **Common error:** `error: author identity unknown`

  * **Solution:** Set your name and email:

    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    ```

### 6️⃣ Link Your Local Repository to GitHub

* Copy the HTTPS URL of your GitHub repository, e.g., `https://github.com/username/project.git`.
* Link it to your local repository:

  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/username/project.git
  ```
* **Common error:** `fatal: remote origin already exists`

  * **Solution:** Remove existing origin first:

    ```bash
    git remote remove origin
    git remote add origin https://github.com/username/project.git
    ```

### 7️⃣ Push Your Project to GitHub

* Push your project to the remote repository:

  ```bash
  git push origin master
  ```
* **Note:** If your default branch is `main`, use:

  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```
* **Common errors and solutions:**

  * `error: failed to push some refs` → Local branch is behind remote:

    ```bash
    git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
    git push origin main
    ```
  * `fatal: Authentication failed` → Use correct GitHub credentials or a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** instead of a password.

### 8️⃣ Verify Your Project is Live

* Go to your GitHub repository URL in your browser.
* You should see all your files uploaded successfully! 🎉

## ✅ Extra Notes & Tips

### Use `.gitignore`

* Add a `.gitignore` file to prevent uploading unnecessary files like `node_modules` or `.env`.

  ```bash
  touch .gitignore
  echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore
  git add .gitignore
  git commit -m "Add .gitignore"
  ```

### Check Status Anytime

* To see which files are staged, unstaged, or untracked:

  ```bash
  git status
  ```

### Undo Mistakes

* Unstage a file:

  ```bash
  git reset filename
  ```
* Revert the last commit (keeps history):

  ```bash
  git reset --soft HEAD~1
  ```
* Discard all local changes (dangerous!):

  ```bash
  git reset --hard
  ```

### Branching

* Create a new branch:

  ```bash
  git branch new-feature
  ```
* Switch to a branch:

  ```bash
  git checkout new-feature
  ```
* Merge branch into main:

  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git merge new-feature
  ```
* Delete a branch:

  ```bash
  git branch -d new-feature
  ```

### Pro Tips 💡

* Always pull changes before pushing to avoid conflicts:

  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```
* Commit often to maintain a clear history.
* Write meaningful commit messages for better collaboration.
* Use branches for features, fixes, and experiments.
